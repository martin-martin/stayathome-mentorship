                    <strong>Help Others Learn Tech Skills:</strong> Simply having technical skills will not solve the
                    economic and societal problems we are currently facing, but it can help some people to put themselves
                    in a more stable position, and gives us all the opportunity to help build more sustainable systems for our communities.
                    In terms of financial stability, tech jobs are still some of the
                    best paid and most in-demand positions in many places around the world, and they can give many
                    people the opportunity to work remotely. Being able to create value remotely and getting paid even
                    during a situation like the current COVID-19 lock-downs is a privilege that we would like
                    to make as available as possible to affected workers.</p>

                    <strong>Your Call:</strong> With giving just 1 hour of your time per week per student, your mentorship can
                    have a positive impact in someone's life.
                    Learning to code is not easy and we know from experience that having a mentor to talk things over with on a
                    regular basis can make all the difference. This is where you come in. You can help someone get started in tech
                    by being at their side for 1 month. That's right, 4 hours of your time can help change someoneâ€™s life for the better.
